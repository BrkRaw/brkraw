# Contributing to BrkRaw

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BrkRaw! Whether you're tackling a bug, adding a new feature, or improving our documentation, every contribution is appreciated. This guide will help you get started with your contributions in the most effective way.

## Ways to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug, have a suggestion, or want to make a feature request, please use the Issues section. Include as much detail as possible and label your issue appropriately.

### Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests with open arms! Here’s how you can make one:

- **Code Changes**: If you are updating the BrkRaw codebase, perhaps due to a ParaVision compatibility issue or to suggest a new standard, please make sure your changes are well-documented. 
- **New Features**: If you're introducing a new feature, ensure that you include appropriate test scripts in the `tests` directory, following our standard testing workflow. Check our documentation for more details.
- **New Applications**: Contributions that significantly enhance community utility but cannot be integrated via the plugin architecture should be directed to the main BrkRaw package.

Before creating a pull request, ensure that your code complies with the existing code style and that you have tested your changes locally.

### Contributing to Child Repositories

- **[tutorial](../brkraw-tutorial)**: For new tutorials, tutorial revisions, or documentation that would help other users, please contribute to this repository.

## Before You Start

Please review the documentation and Q&A to see if your question has already been answered or if the feature has already been discussed. If you’re unsure about adding a feature or making a change, open an issue to discuss it first.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure your contributions are clear and easy to understand.
- Include any necessary tests and documentation updates.
