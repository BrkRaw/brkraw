"""Initialization for the pvobj module.

This module is a cornerstone for interfacing with raw datasets within the Bruker imaging framework.
It provides essential classes for parsing raw datasets, managing parameter metadata, and organizing
data at various levelsâ€”from individual scans to comprehensive experimental sessions.

Classes Exposed:
    PvStudy: Manages data for an entire session, encapsulating all scans and reconstructions.
    PvScan: Handles data related to individual scans, including raw FIDs, acquisition, and method parameters.
    PvReco: Manages data related to image reconstructions within a single scan.
    PvFiles: Provides a flexible container for raw files that may not be systematically organized,
             allowing users to add any files and utilize full module functionalities if all required files are present.
    Parameter: Represents parameter metadata for various components within a scan.
    Parser: Facilitates the parsing of raw dataset information into structured formats.
