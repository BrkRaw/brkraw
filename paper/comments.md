## In regards to the comments that PeerHerholz made. 

1. For the documentation section: 
- The statement of need, currently you have: The 'BrkRaw' is a python module designed to provide a comprehensive tool 
to access raw data acquired from Bruker Biospin preclinical MRI scanner. 
- My question is how so the BrkRaw allow you to acquire this data more efficiently than another 
tool and who could potentially use this tool?
- The other two comments listed under documentation is something that I may not be able to get to as 
I am not sure how to properly demonstrate a 'step-by-step walkthrough for converting real-world date' 
as well as checking the jupyter notebook. 

2. Regarding the Issue Template, Contributing Guideline, and how to get support:
- I have attached an Issue Template and Contributing.md template to Github. 
The support section I think we can add to another page with an email to reach out to for concerns or 
just add it below on the issues template page.  

3. Regarding the 'General' issues he brought up 
- I think overall the general writing has been improved as I have read over it again to double-check; 
so I think that can be checked off. 
The 'Naveau:2019' was stated it's not corrected rendered, 
I think that might be another issue to be fixed in the jupyter notebook.
